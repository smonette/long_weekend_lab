## One project in 72(ish) hours

In the spirit of Jennifer Dewalt's 180 websites in 180 days, we'd like you to revisit JavaScript and create an app over the next 72+ hours using an external library or technology. The goal for this assignment is to add an additional project to your github page that shows off your creativity and styling abilities. __You will be presenting your project on Tuesday morning__ 

Here are a few popular libraries and technologies to check out as you start to think of your idea:

- [jquery](http://jquery.com/) 
- [reveal.js](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/#/)
- [d3.js](http://d3js.org/) 
- [cut.js](http://cutjs.org/)
- [physics.js](http://wellcaffeinated.net/PhysicsJS/)
- [three.js](http://threejs.org/)
- [famo.us](https://famo.us/)
- [chart.js](http://www.chartjs.org/)
- [masonry](http://masonry.desandro.com/)
- [paper.js](http://paperjs.org/)
- [canvas](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Canvas_tutorial)
- css3 transitions - [MDN guide](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/CSS/Using_CSS_transitions) and [an excellent tutorial](http://www.adobe.com/devnet/html5/articles/using-css3-transitions-a-comprehensive-guide.html)

Some tips to help you out:

- Always remember, _"good artists copy, great artists steal."_ Look at other websites and apps that you think are designed well and learn from them. Obviously don't make a direct copy, but derive inspiration from those who design well.

- Check out site websites like:
	- [adobe kuler](https://kuler.adobe.com/) - to see popular color schemes and figure out what colors go well with each other
		- while you are there, learn about the basics of [color theory](http://webdesign.tutsplus.com/articles/an-introduction-to-color-theory-for-web-designers--webdesign-1437) - it is an __essential__ skill if you want to do front-end design/development  
	- [subtlepatters](http://subtlepatterns.com/), to find cool patterns for your backgrounds  
	- [iconfinder](https://www.iconfinder.com/) - for some good looking icons for your project
	- [behance](https://www.behance.net/search?field=102) - to see what people are designing and what the community thinks


## Requirements

- use an external library or new technology to create a website/app of your choice
- focus on styling the app - build something you'd be proud to show others
- commit frequently and push to github often
